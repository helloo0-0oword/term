                  we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                  PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We keep your

                  the PII we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we
                  depend on our users to update or correct their PII whenever

                    applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention
                    obligations imposed on the Company. We may decline to
                    process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
                    systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
                    jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
                    impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
